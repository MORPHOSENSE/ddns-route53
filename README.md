# ddns-route53

Simple bash script for rolling one's own Dynamic DNS updater using AWS Route53.

Source is originally from [Roll your own dynamic DNS service using Amazon Route53](https://willwarren.com/2014/07/03/roll-dynamic-dns-service-using-amazon-route53)
though it's been slightly modified to use OpenDNS and uses environment variables
rather than hardcoded variables in the script.
